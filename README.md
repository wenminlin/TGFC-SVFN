## Title：Text-Guided Fine-grained Counterfactual Inference for Short Video Fake News Detection

### Model Training Process
The model training process is as follows: first train the teacher model, then load the pre-trained teacher model to independently train the video frame student model and the audio student model respectively, and finally train the fusion model.

### Pre-trained Parameters Availability
To facilitate reproducibility, we provide the pre-trained parameters of the teacher model and the two student models via the following link:
